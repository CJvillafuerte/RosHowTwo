Stuff that should probably be done to make repository better/more informative:

- Add ideas/tools for setting up a ROS2 dev enviorment 
    -. Link an IDE with good ROS2 integration
    
    -. Add tools for making working with ROS2 less painful
    (IN PROGRESS)
    
    -. link tutorials explaining how the topic, node, publisher system works.
    
    -. explain how .py launch files work
